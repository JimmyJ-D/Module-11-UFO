#Summary:
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
The website provide greater filtering criteria than just the date, which allows the users a detail search for target data. I recommend incorporating any new sighting into the database. Our current database is limited to US sighting. The website should add another clickhandler() or modify the updatefilters() to return a message to the users when their input parameters are not in the database.
