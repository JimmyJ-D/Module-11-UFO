## Overview and Parameters
In this module we are asked to use build a dynamic table using JavaScript and create a functional web site to query catalog of UFO siting in the database.

## Results:
Using the website Dana has the ability to filter on multiple criteria for UFO sighting such as:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

As an example she can search for any for any sighting in Benton, Arkansas

#Summary:
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
The website provide greater filtering criteria than just the date, which allows the users a detail search for target data. I recommend incorporating any new sighting into the database. Our current database is limited to US sighting. The website should add another clickhandler() or modify the updatefilters() to return a message to the users when their input parameters are not in the database.
