## Overview and Parameters

In this module we are asked to build a dynamic table using JavaScript and create a functional web site using HTML.  The design of the web site is to query a catalog of UFO sighting in a static database.

## Results:

Using the website Dana, our analyst has the ability to filter on multiple criteria for UFO sighting such as:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

As an example she can search for any sighting in Benton, Arkansas

##Summary:

The website provide greater filtering criteria than just the date, which allows the users a detail search for target sighting. I recommend incorporating any new sighting into the database. Our current database is limited to US sighting. The website should add another clickhandler() or modify the updatefilters() to return a message to the users when their input parameters are not in the database.

###Follow the data the truth is out there
